# Add-all-anime-to-my-anime-list
Adds all anime to your MyAnimeList.net watch list and skips over already added items.
    This script adds all anime indiscriminately of genera, so it can and will pull pages for NSFW anime(Hentai, ecchi, erotica, etc.) these sites often have very lewd and inappropriate images on them with mild censory courtesy of MAL, but I would still not recommend letting this program run out in the open for all to see.
requisites

The packages of selenium, time, and webdriver-manager are needed to run this(Must be up to date)
In addition to these Python packages running, you will need to have installed a release for whatever browser is currently supported by this program(currently Firefox)

Any and all bug fixes, optimizations, edits, and changes are welcome.
